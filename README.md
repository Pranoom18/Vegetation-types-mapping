## About

Accurate vegetation mapping is essential for understanding biodiversity, ecosystem health, resource management, and land-use planning in Kondapally. This project demonstrates a robust approach to vegetation classification, leveraging the power of cloud-based processing and machine learning in GEE.

## Key Features

* **Cloud-Based Processing:** Utilizes GEE's scalable platform for efficient analysis of satellite imagery and geospatial data.
* **Machine Learning-Based Classification:** Employs machine learning algorithms (specify the algorithms you used, e.g., Random Forest, SVM, CART) to differentiate vegetation types.
* **Multi-Spectral Analysis:** Leverages spectral information from satellite imagery to identify unique signatures of different vegetation types.
* **Kondapally-Specific:**  Focuses on mapping vegetation in the Kondapally region, tailoring the classification to local conditions and vegetation patterns.

## Study Area

Provide a brief description of the Kondapally region:
* Geographical location (latitude/longitude boundaries)
* Key characteristics (topography, climate, dominant vegetation types)
* Relevance for vegetation mapping (e.g., conservation efforts, agricultural planning)

## Data Sources

* **Sentinel-2:** High-resolution multispectral imagery capturing detailed vegetation characteristics.
* **Landsat:** Long-term archive of satellite imagery for historical context and change analysis (if applicable).
* **Other:**  Any additional datasets used, such as digital elevation models (DEM), climate data, or field-collected vegetation surveys for model validation.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cloud masking, atmospheric correction, and image normalization.
   - Feature engineering (e.g., calculation of vegetation indices like NDVI, EVI, SAVI).
2. **Training Data Collection:**
   - Careful selection of representative training samples for each vegetation class (Forest, Grassland, Cropland, Other) based on ground truth data or expert knowledge.
3. **Classification:** 
   - Training and validation of machine learning models on the prepared dataset.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
4. **Validation:**
   - Assessment of classification accuracy using independent validation data (if available).
   - Evaluation of model performance using metrics like overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and kappa coefficient.

## Results

Showcase your classification results:
* **Vegetation Map:**  Visually appealing map displaying the distribution of classified vegetation types in Kondapally.
* **Accuracy Assessment:**  Table or summary of model performance metrics, including overall accuracy and class-specific accuracies.
* **Discussion:**  Analyze the strengths and limitations of the classification model, potential sources of error, and future improvements.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run your code in GEE:
1. **Open in Google Earth Engine:** Link directly to your GEE script or provide instructions on how to import the code.
2. **Set Parameters:** Guide users on how to customize parameters like region of interest, dates of imagery, and classification scheme.
3. **Run the Script:** Explain the steps to execute the analysis and visualize the results.

## Future Work

* **Refine Classification:** Explore the use of advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning) or ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
* **Temporal Analysis:**  Extend the analysis to track changes in vegetation over time, identifying trends and potential drivers of change.
* **Incorporate Additional Data:**  Integrate auxiliary datasets like climate data, soil maps, or topographic information to enhance the classification model.
